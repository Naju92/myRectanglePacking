# myRectanglePacking
We have a big rectangular metal sheet. We need to cut different rectangular details from this big sheet. So, we need to arrange these rectangular details on a big sheet and optimize their position to pack them tightly. Create a form with two textboxes to enter the width and height of the main sheet. Create a grid where the user can add details with such columns: width, height, and a number of details with this size. User should be able more than one row in this table. Add button “Calculate”. Add a panel. When a user clicks on this button, the application should draw the main sheet on a panel and draw the position of every detail. If it’s impossible to position all details – the application should show a warning message.
